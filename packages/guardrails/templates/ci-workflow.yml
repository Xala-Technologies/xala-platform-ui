# Platform UI Compliance CI Workflow
# ===================================
# MANDATORY: Apps using @xala-technologies/platform-ui MUST include this workflow
#
# Copy this file to: .github/workflows/platform-ui-compliance.yml
#
# This workflow ensures your app complies with Platform UI governance rules:
# 1. No raw HTML elements in source code
# 2. No inline styles without design tokens
# 3. No direct @digdir imports
# 4. ESLint rules are enforced
# 5. Compliance tests pass

              This PR does not meet Platform UI governance requirements.

              ### Required Actions:
              1. Remove raw HTML elements (use platform-ui components)
              2. Use design tokens for all styles
              3. Import from @xala-technologies/platform-ui, not @digdir

              Run \`pnpm guardrails check-compliance\` locally for detailed report.`
