## Verification Commands

### Check for forbidden imports

```bash
# Check for SDK imports in pure components
cd packages/platform-ui/src/features/seasons
grep -r "@digilist/client-sdk" blocks/*.tsx SeasonStatusBadge.tsx constants.ts mappers.ts
# Expected: No results (except in adapters.ts comments)

# Check for i18n imports
grep -r "useT\|@xala-technologies/platform/i18n" blocks/*.tsx SeasonStatusBadge.tsx constants.ts mappers.ts
# Expected: No results

# Check for router imports
grep -r "useNavigate\|react-router" blocks/*.tsx SeasonStatusBadge.tsx constants.ts mappers.ts
# Expected: No results
```

### Check for raw HTML elements

```bash
# Check for raw div usage (should use Stack or Card instead)
grep -E "<div[^>]*style=" blocks/*.tsx SeasonStatusBadge.tsx
# Expected: Only justified uses with design tokens
```

### Verify TypeScript compilation

```bash
cd packages/platform-ui
pnpm typecheck
# Expected: No errors in seasons feature
```

### Verify boundaries

```bash
cd packages/platform-ui
pnpm verify:boundaries
# Expected: No violations in seasons feature
```

### Verify design tokens

```bash
cd packages/platform-ui
pnpm verify:design-tokens
# Expected: No violations in seasons feature
